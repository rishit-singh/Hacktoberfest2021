## My Hacktoberfest repository.

## Introduction

Greetings, fellow programmers!

This is my repository for the Hacktoberfest 2021 which is meant to be an open source archive for useful code.

You can contribute any useful tools, algorithms and data structures, or anything else that you think is significant and can help people out there who might use your code as a reference.

## Rules:

There are a few rules you must follow before creating a pull request.

1. Your code should be well written and usable in generic cases.
2. Test your implementations well before pushing them.
3. Comment your code where its needed to help others understand it. 
4. Use your best programming practices, and optimize the code if you can.
5. Put your code in the corresponding directory. In case no relevant directory exists, feel free to create one with a 
   naming convention similar to that of other directory names.

And that's it!

Note: Please don't bother forking this repo if all you care about is a T Shirt, your PR will be rejected if it doesnt follow the rules.
