# Hacktoberfest2021
My Hacktoberfest repository.

## Introduction

Greetings, fellow programmers!

This is my repository for the Hacktoberfest 2021 which is meant to be an open source archive for useful code.

You can contribute any useful tools, algorithms and data structures, or anything else that you think is significant and can help people out there who might use your code as a reference.

## Rules:

There are a few rules you must follow before creating a pull request.

1. Your code should be well written and usable in generic cases.
2. Test your implementations well before pushing them.
3. Comment your code where its needed to help others understand your code. 
4. Use your best programming practices, and optimize the code if you can.

And that's it!

Note: Please don't bother forking this repo if all you care about is a T Shirt, your PR will be rejected if it doesnt follow the rules.
